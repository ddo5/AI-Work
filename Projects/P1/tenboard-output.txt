Running with cleverness  OFF

KILLED.   After waiting literally overnight for it to finish, it was still going hard the next day.
So I killed it off.  Just too big for non-optimized code!

Note, however, that is did NOT run out of memory...just took long.  After we talk about Ch3, you should be able to say a lot more about what this implies.



OKAY, so now here is the run output with some cleverness turned on:
